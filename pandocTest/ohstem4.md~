# Roadblocks

## Bob didn't keep a journal

## Bob kept a journal, but won't show Alice his notes

## Alice contributes significantly to the project, and Bob doesn't give her credit

## A device breaks; Bob won't show Alice the internals

## Alice wants to modify the device; Bob won't show Alice the internals

## Alice makes a new device, but doesn't share the results back with the group

## Alice makes a new device, but doesn't include Bob's designs in the new schematics
